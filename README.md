# GAME STORE RENTING MANAGEMENT

Our store offers a wide selection of games for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and other popular gaming systems. Customers can browse the game list, view trailers and images, and make bookings for game rentals. Each game in our store comes with a detailed description, and customers can rate and review the games they have rented.

We also offer a monthly subscription service that allows customers to rent as many games as they want for a flat fee. Our wiki provides detailed information on subscription plans and how to sign up.

As an admin, you will have full control over the game list, its status, and the revenue generated by the store. You can create new customer accounts and order bookings for game rentals. Our wiki provides detailed instructions and best practices for managing the store and its inventory.

Our rental system allows customers to book games for half-day rentals. With each rental, customers earn points that can be used for future rentals. Loyal customers can receive discounts on each rental, and they can also apply discount codes for additional savings.

Our customer dashboard provides a history of each customer's rental and status history. Our wiki provides instructions for customers on how to access their dashboard and how to manage their rental history.

In our wiki, you can also find our policies and guidelines for customers and administrators, including rules for renting, guidelines for rating and reviewing games, and best practices for managing customer accounts and orders.
