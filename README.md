# GAME STORE RENTING MANAGEMENT

Our store offers a wide selection of games for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and other popular gaming systems. Customers can browse the game list, view trailers and images, and make bookings for game rentals. Each game in our store comes with a detailed description, and customers can rate and review the games they have rented.

Our customer dashboard provides a history of each customer's rental and status history. Our wiki provides instructions for customers on how to access their dashboard and how to manage their rental history.
